# Wav2lip_SuperResolution

## README

This repository contains a Wav2Lip model with GAN for improved lip syncing and employing ERSGAN for High Resoultion video of LipSyncs.

To use the model in Google Colab, simply click on the following link:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F6Bj8G1eiktudzuusKYdHRiJOPlpA4-L?usp=sharing

This will open a Google Colab notebook with the Wav2Lip model.

## Sample Inputs

Video-https://openinapp.co/5cwva 

Audio-https://openinapp.co/o9vuj

## Usage

To generate a lip-syncing video, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the google colab with the link provided above.
2. Install the pre-required dependencies and the Wav2Lip model.
3. In the Google Colab notebook, mount your Google Drive account.
4. Upload the video file that you want to generate a lip-syncing video.
5. Upload the audio file that you want to generate a lip-syncing video.
6. Then in last cell to churn the data add specifiactions of padding based on your own needs.
7. Then finally run the last cell  to generate the lip-syncing video.
8. Finally connect the Lipsynced video with ERSGAN part install the pre-required dependencies.
9. Train on each frame.
10. Get Final Video.
